## Web Capabilities: Distributed Authorization For The Open Web

*Web Capabilities* provide authorization to perform a set of HTTP requests. They are modeled after [capability security models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security). Web capabilities adapt this idea by using cryptographic signatures to ensure they cannot be forged. They naturally extend the state transfer design of the Open Web, since they can be sent to the client, much like cookies.

### **Adversarial (Zero Trust)**

In distributed systems like the Web, [you can't trust the network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing). So Web capabilities aim to be adversarial in the evaluation of a request. (This also sometimes referred to as [zero-trust architecture](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/library/implementing-zero-trust-architecture).)

This is why Web capabilities must not only be cryptographically signed by the issuer, but also the by client exercising a grant (a capabilities signed by the issuer), which provides [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation)) and guards against request tampering.  We can prove that a particular person sent a particular HTTP request with a particular set of URL, header, and body properties.

Web capabilities also follow the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), since they can be verified without privileged access.

### Standards-based

The design of HTTP and other Web specifications is to [Create More Web](https://www.pandastrike.com/posts/20151019-create-more-web/). The Web accumulates value with each contribution to the ecosystem we all share and benefit from. 

Capabilites can be moved across the network and verified by intermediaries. That's reflected in the entity names, issuer-recipient rather than server-client. This encourages decentralization and follows the principle of least privilege. It's more secure to verify requests outside of the main API process space. If an attacker manages to trigger an unexpected code path, they are less likely to have access to sensitive data. Web capabilities can even be verified in a system owned entirely by a third party.

### Comprehensive

Web Capabilities support delegation, revocation, key rotation, and expiry and embargoes. Anything you can do with access-control authorization, you can do with Web capabilities.

### Performant

Web Capabilities use a fast hashing algorithm for signatures. Sometimes even that is too slow, so Web Capabilities also support memoization, which converts a verified grant into a simple hash that supports sub-millisecond verification.

## The Capability Document

A Capability is a simple document describing an allowed action. Web Capabilities describe an HTTP request.

### Capability Document

This capability allows Leia to update or delete her posts:

    methods:
    - PUT
    - PATCH
    - DELETE
    - OPTIONS  # necessary for CORS
    template: "https://api.rebelalliance.com/posts/leia/{id}"
    recipient: "RFfBy/1mioLtrsxk2CifDz/V3N4TauSca+xlwNN+wEI="
    use:
    - "XL9Jjv8cOs0TrNOJLhQ0eQbNeE7n67Zk//iToaB7UpA="

Through the use of URL templates specified in [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570), you can describe a set of HTTP requests on a collection of resources in an API. Web capabilities support flexible permission specification. Specify coarse-grained access with parameterization, or restrict the recipient to a single URL and HTTP method combination.

A Web capability includes at least two public signing keys. One belonging to the recipient and one assigned by the issuer as a use key pair. Together, they grant flexible public key registry control. The use key pair allows for the revocation of the individual capability, while the recipient key pair allows for the revocation all capabilities associated with a recipient.

## Introducing Cobalt

Capabilities work as a security model by using the power of digital signatures; however, for every Web capability, there are at least 3 pairs of signing keys to consider. And because Web capabilities can be fine-grained, an application developer will likely need to deal with dozens of key pairs and their resultant cryptographic products.

We developed Cobalt to manage this complexity with a high-level interface. In the examples that follow, we will lay out a Web Capability spec and its high-level execution via the Cobalt interface.

## Issuing to the Recipient: Grants and Directories

Alone, a Web capability is a mere description of an action. It is given force when digitally signed by the issuer to create a *grant*.

The capability within a grant contains only public keys (fields `publicUse` and `recipient`). So alongside a grant, the issuer needs to bundle the matching use key pair(s).

Because Web capabilities can be fine-grained, we will end up with a collection of grants and their corresponding use key pairs. Cobalt has a container class called a `Directory` [to](http://directory.to) mange them.  

Grants are organized by URL template and HTTP method in a 2-D dictionary.  Together, they reference a given grant and its corresponding use key pair(s).  You can lookup an entry directly with `directory[<URL Template>][<HTTP Method>]`, but in practice you will use Cobalt's `lookup` function (see below).

The `Directory` class also has methods to support serialization and hydration.

### Directory Entry

### Example: Issuer

The API issues a directory containing some grants for Leia with  `issue`, a Cobalt function.  `issue` accepts an array of capability stubs along with the API's and Leia's signing keys. Use key pairs are generated for each capability automatically.

    import {confidential} from "panda-confidential"
    import PandaCapability from "@dashkte/cobalt"
    
    Confidential = confidential()
    {issue} = PandaCapability Confidential
    
    leiaDirectory = await issue apiSignatureKeyPair, leiaPublicSignatureKey, [
          template: "/profiles/leia/dashes"
          methods: ["OPTIONS", "POST"]
        ,
          template: "/profiles/leia/dashes/{id}"
          methods: ["OPTIONS", "GET", "PUT", "DELETE"]
      ]
    
    # directories are 2-D dictionaries, but in practice we use the function `lookup`.
    {useKeyPairs, grant} = leiaDirectory["/profiles/leia/dashes"]["POST"]

The issuer signs each capability, creating a set of grants organized in a directory.

In theory, the issuer could issue a grant for every resource at the moment of its creation. The resulting directory with a single entry could then be placed into the `capability` response header. This is similar to the use of the `location` header on `201 Created` responses.

However, our current approach is for the issuer to use URL templates and anticipate the creation of future, specific resources. 

1. Because Leia's directory contains whole use key pairs, we consider a directory private and ideally the issuer should not store this entity.  We also recommend employing encryption for transport and storage.
2. Establishing the directory as an API resource provides a convenient structure for the recipient to refresh their directory and public key registry (revoking the old keys) at will.  This is also useful for establishing device authorization flows.  

Since the directory refresh endpoint requires authorization, we need a bootstrapping flow.  We use the `capability` header in the response to the HTTP request that establishes the recipient's identity within the issuer's API.  The recipient gets a directory with only one entry, the capability to refresh their directory.  

### Example: Recipient

In the API, we can use the Confidential interface to ready Leia's directory for transport:

    {SharedKey, Message, encrypt} = Confidential
    
    key = SharedKey.create apiEncryptionKeyPair.privateKey, leiaPublicEncryptionKey
    
    envelope = await encrypt key,
      Message.from "utf8", leiaDirectory.to "utf8"
    
    # The directory is now suitable to be sent to Leia's device as a response body.
    responseBody = envelope.to "base64"

In Leia's device, she can decrypt and store the directory using the Confidential and Cobalt interfaces. Remember that the directory is secret, ideally not stored by the issuer, and should be encrypted when stored.

    import {confidential} from "panda-confidential"
    import PandaCapability from "@dashkte/cobalt"
    
    Confidential = confidential()
    {SharedKey, Envelope, decrypt, Message} = Confidential
    {Directory} = PandaCapability Confidential
    
    # API request resulting in a fetch of Leia's encrypted directory.
    serializedEnvelope = await fetchMyDirectory()
    
    key = SharedKey.create myEncryptionKeyPair.privateKey, apiPublicEncryptionKey
    
    message = decrypt key,
      Envelope.from "base64", serializedEnvelope
    
    # Leia now has an instantiated directory of her grants.
    directory = Directory.from "bytes", message.to "bytes"
    
    # Encrypt when storing.
    key = SharedKey.create myEncryptionKeyPair
    toLocalStorage await encrypt key, Message.from "bytes", directory.to "bytes"

## Exercising a Grant

For the recipient to exercise a capability it must first be granted by the issuer. So, as a shorthand, we say the recipient exercises a grant. The steps to exercise a grant include:

1. Looking up the grant from the directory.
2. Creating an *assertion*, which includes the grant.
3. Signing the assertion with the recipient's key pair and use key pair to finalize.
4. Setting the `Authorization` request header.

### Creating Assertions

As a dictionary, the recipient could directly lookup a grant based on a URL template and HTTP method, ex: `directory[<template>][<method>]`.

In practice, we don't want to directly use a grant. We instead add parameters that add specificity to our authorization and a nonce to mitigate replay attacks. The recipient assembles a document that includes:

The recipient then signs the document twice:  

1. With the use key pair
2. With the recipient's key pair

This forms an *assertion*.

To summarize: the recipient exercises a grant from their directory to form an assertion of their capability. 

> Note: Remember that a Web capability include multiple signing keys for flexible public key registry control.  See the section describing the capability document for more information.

### Set The `Authorization` Header

The assertion is Base64 encoded and added to the request `Authorization` header, using the `capability` authorization type. This makes it available for inspection and validation.

## Cobalt Manages Complexity

Cobalt's interface is designed to keep application developers from worrying too much about the tedium of juggling signing keys and their products

### Example

Leia wants to make an authorized request to delete an existing dash with the ID `DeathStarExhaust`. 

    {lookup, exercise} = PandaCapability Confidential
    
    # Client looks up the relevant grant from Leia's directory, matching using
    # only the URL. (URL could come from panda-sky-client)
    methods = lookup directory, "/profiles/leia/dashes/foobardashID"
    
    # Client then uses the HTTP method to get the directory entry.
    {grant, useKeyPairs} = methods.DELETE
    
    # Client specifies the parameters for the grant
    parameters =
      url:
        id: "DeathStarExhaust"
    
    # Client exercises the grant using Leia's signature key pair and the
    # grant it just looked up. Yields an Assertion, another
    # Cobalt container class.
    assertion = exercise mySignatureKeyPair, useKeyPairs, grant, parameters
    
    # When the client forms the HTTP request, it just needs to serialize the
    # assertion and place into the Authorization header.
    request =
      url: "/profiles/alice/dashes/DeathStarExhaust"
      method: "DELETE"
      headers:
        authorization: "Capability #{assertion.to "base64"}"

Given a URL and HTTP method, Cobalt lets the application developer easily lookup the appropriate grant and then exercise it to create an assertion with the robust authority of the issuer and recipient digital signatures.

## Verification

Consider an API handling a request containing a capability assertion.  We are concerned with two objectives:

1. Rigorously verifying the internal consistency of the assertion
2. Checking a public key registry to confirm the involved parties have not revoked their participation.

Neither of those objectives requires privileged access: (1) contemplates data *within* the assertion, while (2) is a check on *public* data.

In fact, the verification flow can occur outside of the issuer API; either within an intermediary (such as an edge cache for proxy server), or within a system belonging entirely to a third party.

Cobalt provides a simple interface to perform (1).  It confirms:

- the request matches the signatures from issuer, recipient, and use key pairs
- the listed signatories correspond to the signatures
- the request parameters match the actual request
- the timestamp used as a nonce is within the +/- 30 second tolerance.

Cobalt leaves (2) up to the implementer.  You must go to the relevant public key registry and perform a lookup to confirm that the key pairs involved have not been revoked.

### Example

The `DELETE` request from Leia makes its way to the API for verification.

    {parse, challenge} = PandaCapability Confidential
    
    fail = (message) ->
      console.warn message
    	throw new Unauthorized message
    
    handler = (request) ->
    	# Objective 1: Signature Validity Check
    	try
    	  assertion = parse request
    	  challenge request, assertion
    	catch e
    	   console.warn e
    	   throw new Unauthorized()
    
      # Objective 2: Public Key Revocation Check
      claim = assertion.publicKeys
      registry = await fetchRegistry()
    
      fail "issuer key does not match" unless claim.issuer == apiSignaturePublicKey
      fail "invalid use key" unless registry.has claim.use
      fail "invalid recipient key" unless registry.has claim.recipient
